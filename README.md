# Online Shopping System (Java, OOPS)

## Problem Statement
In many real-world applications, online shopping platforms require a structured way to manage products, allow users to add items to a cart, and place orders efficiently. For beginners learning Java, understanding how to design such systems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles is essential. The challenge is to simulate these core functionalities in a simple, clean, and well-organized manner without unnecessary complexity.

## Project Description
This project is a console-based Online Shopping System developed using Java. It simulates the fundamental workflow of an online shopping platform, including product browsing, cart management, and order placement. The main focus of this project is not on advanced features or databases, but on clean class design, modular structure, and logical separation of responsibilities.

Each functionality of the system is handled by a dedicated class to ensure clarity and maintainability. The project is intentionally kept simple so that the design and logic can be easily understood and explained, especially during interviews or academic evaluations.

## Solution Approach
The solution is implemented using core Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system is divided into multiple classes, each representing a specific responsibility:
- The **Product** class represents individual products with basic details.
- The **Cart** class manages adding and viewing products selected by the user.
- The **Order** class handles the order placement process.
- The **Main** class serves as the entry point and coordinates the overall execution flow.

This structured approach ensures loose coupling between components, better readability, and easier future enhancements. The program runs in the console and demonstrates the complete flow from product browsing to successful order placement.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**
  - Classes and Objects  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Association  
  - Modular Design
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
